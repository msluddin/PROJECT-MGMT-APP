1. We will be using a package called express-graphql which is a GraphQL server for Node.js with tools to use with Express.
2. For Front-end use to Apollo Client, React, Bootstrap UI
3. For Server use to GraphQL, Node.js, Express.
4. Also MongoDB
5. First install $ npm init -y
6. The simplest way to run a GraphQL API server is to use Express
   $npm install express express-graphql graphql --save or $yarn add express express-graphql graphql
7. Now installl mongoose for Database and $colors and $nodemon for devDependencies.
8. Server and React connection than install $yarn add cors and $dotenv
9. For Front-end now install $npx create-react-app client Or $yarn create react-app client
10. Applications that use Apollo Client require two top-level dependencies:
    @apollo/client
    graphql
11. npm install @apollo/client graphql Or yarn add @apollo/client graphql
