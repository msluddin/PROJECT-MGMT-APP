We will be using a package called express-graphql which is a GraphQL server for Node.js with tools to use with Express.
For Front-end use to Apollo Client, React, Bootstrap UI
For Server use to GraphQL, Node.js, Express.
Also MongoDB
First install $ npm init -y
The simplest way to run a GraphQL API server is to use Express
$npm install express express-graphql graphql --save or $yarn add express express-graphql graphql
Now installl mongoose for Database and $colors and $nodemon for devDependencies.
Server and React connection than install $yarn add cors and $dotenv
For Front-end now install $npx create-react-app client Or $yarn create react-app client
Applications that use Apollo Client require two top-level dependencies:
@apollo/client
graphql
npm install @apollo/client graphql Or yarn add @apollo/client graphql
Also install $react-router-dom @react-icons
